# Newsletter Scraper

This program is meant to scrap the values needed for the newsletter published by [Stratefi203](http://www.stratefi203.com/), to compute the weekly and YTD returns and to create a table with the values. This module is an early developer preview, and is not suitable for general usage yet. Features and implementation are subject to change.

The desired output is a PNG [file](https://github.com/Arthurim/Stratefi203/blob/master/pictures/Table.png).

## Getting Started

You need to have two CSV files in order to make this program run.
The first one, [ComputingTable](https://github.com/Arthurim/Stratefi203/blob/master/pictures/ComputingTable.JPG) is used to perform the computation.

The second one, [ValuesTable](https://github.com/Arthurim/Stratefi203/blob/master/pictures/ValuesTable.JPG) is the table in which we save the desired outputs and from which we create the table as a PNG file.

## Methodology

The program is divided in two parts
- the scraping part
- the graphing part

### Scraping

## Future work
